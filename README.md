# Multivariate-Data-Visualization

## Introduction

This repository explores Multivariate Data isualization using Walmart's dataset, encompassing 45 locations from 2010 to 2012. The analysis delves into the relationships and patterns among variables like Holidays, Temperature, Fuel Price, Consumer Price Index (CPI), and Unemployment.

## Dataset Description

The dataset facilitates a detailed investigation of retail performance, including weekly sales, store details, dates, and additional metrics like temperature, unemployment rate, and CPI. Key variables include Weekly Sales, Store Information, Date, Additional Metrics, and Holiday Events.

**In this project, I have focused on Walmart's dataset, exploring:**

1.	Correlation between Consumer Price Index (CPI), Weekly Sales, and Fuel Price.
2.	Quarterly Growth Rate in Q3’2012 for the top 5 stores
3.	Distribution of Weekly Sales by store during Holiday Events for the top 10 stores
4.	Correlation between CPI and Unemployment from 2010 to 2012.
5.	Exploration of Weekly Sales vs. Temperature during 2010, 2011 and 2012.
